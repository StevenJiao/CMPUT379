Assignment 2: Producer-Consumer Problem

Included files:
    * prodcon.cpp
    * prodcon.hpp
    * writer.cpp
    * tandc.c
    * Makefile
    * README

Run instructions:
    1. Unzip the prodcon_syjiao.zip file into a working directory
    2. Navigate to the directory and run "make"
    3. The prodcon program can now be run, as specified by assignment 2 specifications
        ex. run the command(s):
            "./prodcon 3 1 <input" or "./prodcon 3 <input" where input is
            a file containing the inputs as formatted for assignment 2 (ex. T for consumer work
            and S for producer sleep), the first position argument (ex. 3) is the number of threads, 
            and second, optional input arg (ex. 1) being the log file name.
            or "./prodcon 3" and specify input on command line (then writing EOF with ctrl+d)

About files:
    * prodcon.cpp: 
        * the main file for handling producer parsing of input and 
            directing consumer work as threads. It will also call a writer
            for writing to the output file. 
    * prodcon.hpp: 
        * the header file for prodcon.cpp; contains global vars that are
            accessible by consumers, and other static definitions of string for 
            writing to the log file what the producers and consumers are doing
    * writer.cpp:
        * a writer class that handles the threadsafe appending to an output
            file for logging purposes
        * also contains a struct for holding summary statistics for the
            number of jobs, number of sleeps, and etc.
        * has a timer for logging the time of logs and calculating the 
            work done per second for the summary

General approach:
    *
